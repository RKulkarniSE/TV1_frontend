You have 2 options to running the frontend.

1. Use GitHub codespaces: This option is if you don't want to install dependencies, packages and you don't want to worry
about the software setup too much and you simply want to run the frontend as it currently is. Refer to "GitHub Setup" instructions

2. Clone the repo to your local machine. This option is for people that want to make changes to the code and add features, or 
you want to learn about how this works and you're just curious. Refer to "Local Setup" instructions
