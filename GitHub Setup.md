## TV1 FRONTEND
If you don't want to install the frontend code to your local machine, and would like to run
the frontend from the cloud then follow these instructions. Otherwise refer to the "Local Setup"
instructions file. 

## SETUP
1. Go to the repository location at https://github.com/RKulkarniSE/TV1_frontend

2. To open in GitHub web editor hit the fullstop button "." on your keyboard 

3. On the web editor open the terminal with the shortcut Ctrl + `` or use the web editor's GUI to 
do the same thing

4. Click the option to "Continue Working in GitHub Codespaces". Once this happens you will get the option to 
select the specifications of the virtual machine (choose whatever you want)

5. If you have opened a new codespace, the cloud computer will automatically start downloading and install dependencies
so just give it two minutes to do what it needs to do.

6. Once dependencies are installed run the command "npm start" and you should get a prompt to "Open in Browser". Select that

## CONCLUSION
Now your done! The frontend should spin up in a browser while you run the backend code on your local machine.
